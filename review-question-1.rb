# How would you get the url for Bulbasaur's ability?
puts pokemon[0][:abilities][0][:ability][:url]
# How would you return the first pokemon with base experience over 40?
pokemon.find do |pokemon|
    pokemon[:base_experience] > 40
end
# How would you return ALL OF THE pokemon with base experience over 40? (Gotta catch em all)
pokemon.select do |pokemon|
    pokemon[:base_experience] > 40
end
# How would you return an array of all of the pokemon's names?
pokemon.map do |pokemon|
    pokemon[:name]
end
# How would you determine whether or not the pokemon array contained any pokemon with a weight greater than 60?
pokemon.any? do |pokemon|
    pokemon[:weight] > 60
end

#  whatever method you use should return true if there are any such pokemon, false if not.
#puts pokemon.include?(pokemon[:weight] > 60)
